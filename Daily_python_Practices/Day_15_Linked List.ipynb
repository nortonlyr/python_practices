    "A Node class is provided for you in the editor. A Node object has an integer data field, , and a Node instance pointer, , pointing to another node (i.e.: the next node in a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Node insert function is also declared in your editor. It has two parameters: a pointer, , pointing to the first node of a linked list, and an integer value that must be added to the end of the list as a new Node object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task Complete the insert function in your editor so that it creates a new Node (pass as the Node constructor argument) and inserts it at the tail of the linked list referenced by the parameter. Once the new node is added, return the reference to the node.\n",

    ", so the locked code in the editor will be inserting nodes. The list is initially empty, so is null; accounting for this, our code returns a new node containing the data value as the of our list. We then create and insert nodes , , and at the tail of our list. The resulting list returned by the last call to is , so the printed output is 2 3 4 1.\n",
