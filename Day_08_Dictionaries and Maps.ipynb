    "Task Given names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form name=phoneNumber; if an entry for is not found, print Not found instead.\n",

    "The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of entries in the phone book. Each of the subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an -digit phone number.\n",

    "After the lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.\n",
